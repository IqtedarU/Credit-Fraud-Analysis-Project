#### Project Information
This project was done about a year ago just to get an idea on working with imbalanced datasets. It goes through all major steps which is data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, model training, cross validation, and testing on test set for the final model. this is shown in the jupytr notebook.

I did check to make sure this ran since it was old and did part of the analysis again just to be sure that what I did was correctly done.
